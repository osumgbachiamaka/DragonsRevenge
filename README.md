Now here's what we're meant to do:
>>Using the Amazon Transcribe API (https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/), make a simple website using Oracle JET (for the frontend), where you can upload an MP3 and it transcribes it automatically into Text and shows you the text on the webpage. The page should show two different transcriptions - one using the Amazon Transcribe API and the other using Google Speech-To-Text (https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/). The page should be seamless and very simple : upload an mp3 (without refreshing page) it tells you it is processing, then once it is done, it outputs all the text in the MP3 on the page (all without refreshing). It *must* be done using Oracle JET.

>>First team who delivers a fully working product wins. Criteria to win: website does not have glitches. File uploads fine. Textual output shows (two variants).

#     Goodnews...
We are winning this. Now lets get to WORK.
